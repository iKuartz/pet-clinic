# Pet-Clinic
This is a relational database with the data structure for a vet clinic; a complete database with data about:

    animals
    animals' owners
    clinic employees
    visits

Apart from building data structure, the database will create SQL queries to answer specific questions.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Run PostgreSQL on your machine, and then start psql to start inputting the data on the files. 
- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
